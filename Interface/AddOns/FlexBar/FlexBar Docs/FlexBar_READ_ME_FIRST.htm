<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<p align="center"><strong><em><font size="5">Read Me 
First</font></em></strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong><em>Changes from 1.36 to 1.37</em></strong></p>
<p align="left"><strong>Introduction:&nbsp; </strong>I realize it's a pain when I 
change structural details in FlexBar and you have to change your setups.&nbsp; I 
give a lot of thought to these things before doing it.&nbsp; Please remember I 
still consider FlexBar to be <strong><em>Alpha Software.</em></strong>&nbsp; 
Until I am satisfied with the feature set (not until pet buttons at least) and 
satisfied with a low enough number of known issues will I move it to beta 
status.&nbsp; Once I do that I will be even more reluctant to change things like 
these.&nbsp; Until then, these changes were necessary to allow me to keep 
extending it without working around poor design decisions made early on.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Buttons Above 72:</strong>&nbsp; Prior to this, there were 
96 buttons, and the buttons above 72 did NOT have a 1-1 mapping of default ID to 
button number the way buttons 1-72 did.&nbsp; In order to fix this, I have 
increased the number of buttons to 120 and now there is a 1-1 mapping of default 
ID to button #.&nbsp; That means that, before you remap anything, button 73 has 
ID 73, button 88 has ID 88 and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">What this means for prior users - The apparent location of your 
abilities on buttons 73-96 will move.&nbsp; Abilities that were on 85-96 will 
now be on 109-120.&nbsp; For all but warriors and druids, abilities that were on 
73-84 will now be on 97-108.&nbsp; If you had abilities on these buttons and you 
were just remapping to them, then no change needs to be made as they are still 
at the same ID.&nbsp; If you were displaying those buttons and not remapping to 
them, just display the new buttons, drag the abilities to the old buttons and 
you're done.&nbsp; Finally if you were both displaying those buttons and 
remapping to those ID's - you will have to move the abilities back to the old 
buttons, and change and remapping commands to reference the new ID's.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>SetTexture:</strong>&nbsp; SetTexture used to set the 
texture by button #.&nbsp; This has changed to setting the texture by ID 
#.&nbsp; This is to facilitate the new features 
flexmacro/flexscript/autoitems.&nbsp; While you can still set on events - this 
ability is mainly for flex-actions (and later pet buttons).</p>
<p align="left"><STRONG>/wait command:</STRONG>   &nbsp; Has been 
changed to /fbwait to avoid replacing /wait voice emote.</p>
<P align=left><STRONG>Extending FlexBar:</STRONG>&nbsp; The way you hook into 
WoW events has changed - please read that section.</P>
<p align="left"><strong>IsUsable</strong>:&nbsp; While this isn't my change, it 
warrants a word.&nbsp; In interface version 1.4 of WoW, Blizzard change the 
return value of IsUsableAction.&nbsp; Originally it only indicated that a 
prerequisite event had happened, (dodge for overpower, parry for riposte 
etc.).&nbsp; Now it indicates that : A prerequisite event has happened, 
<strong><em>you are in the correct stance</em></strong>, you have enough 
mana/rage/energy and it is out of cooldown.&nbsp; If you are a stance dancing 
warrior who used macros that changed to battle-stance (if you weren't in it) 
then cast overpower (on the next press) and were used to using isusable to light 
up/show your buttons when you were not in the correct stance, this will no 
longer work.</p>
<p align="left">For now, use the new On='TargetCombat' Target='Dodge' to capture 
this and use a timer to hide the button and an On='CooldownStart' to hide 
it.</p>
<p align="left">This isn't the definitive answer, but it is the best I have atm 
I'm afraid.</p>
