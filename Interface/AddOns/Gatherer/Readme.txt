This is Gatherer v2.0.1
http://gatherer.sf.net/

ABOUT:
--------------
Gatherer is an addon for herbalists, miners and treasure hunters in World of Warcraft. It's main purpose is to track the closest plants, deposits and treasure locations on you minimap.

The addon does not track like a tracking ability does, rather it "remembers" where you have found various items in the past. It does this whenever you gather (perform herbalism, mining or opening) on an item, and records the specific map location in it's history. From then on, whenever the item comes into range of being one of the closest 1-25 (configurable) items to your present location, it will pop up on you minimap.

When you view your main map, you will also see the item locations marked on the particular map you are viewing there.

INSTALLATION:
--------------
Extract the data to your "World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns" directory so that the "Gatherer" directory is a subdirectory of the "AddOns" directory.

USAGE:
--------------
Just use the game as normal.
When you gather things, they will appear on your minimap and your main map.
If you want to configure the addon, click the Gatherer configuration icon floating around your minimap frame.
