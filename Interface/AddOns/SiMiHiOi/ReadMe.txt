-- 
-- What is it?
-- 	It allows permanent up or downscaling of the UI without
-- 	having to potch around in the Interface options.  It's
--    also for the scaling, moving and hiding of individual
--    interface elements.
--   
-- Why?
-- 	Simply because Blizzard didn't properly implement it,
-- 	it's nicer to have a slash command and upscaling is
-- 	wholly NOT possible through the Interface options, as
-- 	of now as far as I know, it can only be done via a
-- 	Macro.  I find this unacceptable, this is my solution.
--   
-- How?
-- 	Global scaling: /scaleit scale <value> where <value>
--		is anything from 0.5 to 2.0, I list those as sane
--		(safe) values which I have tested.  I've noticed that
--		this AddOn doesn't play nicely as an 'update', it
--		won't let the user set manual scales and it can spit
--		errors if something else tries to scale or use
--		scaling math, so instead I've set it to only run on
--		UI startup, otherwise it automatically triggers an
--		instance of ReloadUI().  That way it plays nicely
--		with manual scales and any AddOns that might make
--		use of scaling arithmetic.
--
--		Individual scaling: /scaleit <value> <option>, just
--		enter in scaleit for the lowdown.  The rules of global
--		scaling apply here too.  Sane values are 0.5 to 2.0
--		but you can try just about anything.
--
--		Individual moving: /moveit <value> <x or y>, as with
--		scaleit, it's just a matter of using /moveit to see
--		what's available.  This provides a by-pixel granular
--		accurate positioning system for many GUI elements
--		where X is vertical and Y is horizontal.
--
--		Individual hiding: /hideit <value> is a toggle, use
--		just /hideit to see what's available.
--
-- Caveats ...
-- 	Yes, there are some.  For my own reasons I haven't
-- 	placed in any safety checks, I won't patronize you,
-- 	you aren't dumb.  If you were, you wouldn't be
-- 	reading this, eh?  Thusly, you could scale 10.0
-- 	and this would be bad, very bad.  It would cause
-- 	the game to crash every time you load it.  Thusly
-- 	I cite here and for the record that sane values are
-- 	0.5 to 2.0 and those are the only ones you should
-- 	use.  Thems the breaks, literally.

-- 	Rowne.  I'm just this hard of sight Tauren, yanno?
--		Furthermore, I've received lots of aid.  I used
--		Kortalh's TalentReminder AddOn (which I honestly
--		recommend to anyone who even considers playing
--		World of Warcraft), Iriel and Mondinga who provided
--		me with the correct CVar.  In honesty, they did the
--		most work, one by providing me with the line of
--		code I need, the other by providing a well written
--		and documented AddOn.  All I did was patch the
--		relevant aspects together.

--		Contributor Credits: Mook for ... lots of things.
--		Look for the 'Added by Mook' section below to
--		see exactly what he's added.  Want your name in
--		here too?  Contribute stuff!  It's easier than
--		ya think and I'd love to see this become more of
--		a widespread community tool than just an average
--		AddOn, wot?
--
--		I borrowed Jooky's 'get player name' code too so
--		he gets contributor credits and major kudos for
--		making the only 'get player name' code I could
--		actually get to work for me.  His code makes so
--		much sense, it's so clean, organized and well
--		commented.  Jooky is a coding God, PRAISE HIM!
