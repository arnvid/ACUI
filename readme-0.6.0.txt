PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE FILE BEFORE CONTACTING ME OR TRYING TO INSTALL THIS UI!!!!

Introduction:
-------------
This UI compilation is an continuance of RHM's UI pack. I have taken the
liberty to update, replace and add AddOn's from the original pack. This
never version have been tested for 1.11.0 (EU).

After ACUI version 0.4.0 it's been tweaked and I've tried to put focus into
easy install and better crafting.

This UI is mainly focused on the magic users and crafters, leaving many 
options open for the player and atm there are several add-on's being
built to ease the use of magic and crafts.

Remeber. This UI Compilation is not the easiest one to install but it works
very well if your a spellcaster.

UPDATE: Hopefully I've managed to make it a bit easier to install.

DISCLAIMER:
-----------
No animals where hurt during the testing of this UI Collection. Only my IRL 
friends had to deal with the constant frustrations that the WoW UI can 
cause. The author of this collection, or any author of any AddOn used 
in this collection can not (!) be held responsible for any hardware
or software problems you may experience while using this package. Any claims
will be forwarded to /dev/null and ignored.

Know bugs:
----------

* Chat windows look akward after 1.11, need to press the Tabs for it to reveal itself-

Contact me?
-----------

Sure, if there is something you want to ask or give feedback on please do
so. My email address is arnvid <AT> gmail.com.  Alternatively use the
forums or online in wow. I play on the european server Turalyon as Cerebro
and Asys.
 

Credits:
--------

The UI compilation in it's current state is maintained by Arnvid Karstad and
some addon's have been modified to better suite this compilation.

I acknowledge that this UI Compilation would most likely not exist without
the original UI pack from RHM. It can be found on the following URL's:

http://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php?addid=411
http://ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php?id=359


Personal modifications:
-----------------------

* Removed the borders surrounding Telo's clock
* Removed loading of some parts of bibmod
* Changed minmap location codes for modules.
* Updated AvgXP and QuickCash for 11100 compliance
* Updated MyInventory for 11100 compliance
* Updated MyBank for running smoothly on 11100

To Be Done:
-----------

* Mod more AddOn's to use a similar username variable. Why on earth
  must the use " of ", ":", "|" and " - ". 5 Diffrent styles are used
  here and it's a total mess.
